# 11-3. Employee: Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method
# should take in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and
# store each of these as attributes. Write a method called give_raise()
# that adds $5,000 to the annual salary by default but also accepts a
# different raise amount.

# Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods, 
# test_give_default_raise() and test_give_custom_raise(). 
# Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t have to create a new
# employee instance in each test method. Run your test case,
# and make sure both tests pass.
